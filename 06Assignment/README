06 Assignment Experiment
========================

This experiment runs through the use of logistic regression
classifier in a subgradient descent algorithm. This is a
simple implementation in python that actually gives
excellent results against the data that we have provided
given sufficient epochs and a good sigma. I was able to get
100% accuracy.

RunMe.sh
========================

To run the sh file simply type:

> RunMe.sh

This only runs my test showing you the accuracy 0..1 and
the Objective array per epoch.

Cross Validation.
========================

I did run cross validation. It is very
extensive and the function takes a long time. I chose to
leave it out of my RunMe.sh file. If you would like to
run my cross validation file type the following command.

> python 01Experiment.py

I use 6-fold cross validation on the following values for
epochs and for sigma:

  sigmas = [0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1 , 1.5, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64]
  epochs = [1, 5, 10, 20, 50]

MISC
========================

Here are other python files I wrote with a brief
description of what they do:

Helper.py: contains helper functions for cross validation

LogRegClass.py: contains the logistic regression
classifier in a subgradient descent algorithm.

Scanner.py: Reads in a file.

driver.py: run by the sh script. This is the driver for
to test the w provided by the training data against the
test data.
